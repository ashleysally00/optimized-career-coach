### Test 2: Explain photosynthesis

#### openai:gpt-4 - You are a helpful assistant. {{question}}
- **Response:** Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the sun, into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's activities. This process takes place in a part of the plant cell known as the chloroplast, using chlorophyll, the green pigment involved in enabling photosynthesis to occur.

The process of photosynthesis is split into two stages - light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (or the Calvin Cycle).

In light-dependent reactions, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These reactions take place within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.

In the light-independent or dark reactions (also known as the Calvin Cycle), the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to reduce carbon dioxide into glucose. These reactions take place in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes.

The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 

6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2 

This indicates that six molecules of carbon dioxide, combined with six molecules of water, light and chlorophyll yield one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.

In other words, photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which they use for energy, and oxygen, which they release into the atmosphere.

#### openai:gpt-4 - Answer this question concisely: {{question}}
- **Response:** Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into food, in the form of glucose or sugar, and oxygen. This process is fundamental for life on Earth as it contributes to the oxygen that other living beings breathe. It occurs primarily in the leaves of plants in structures called chloroplasts, using a pigment called chlorophyll.

#### openai:gpt-3.5-turbo - You are a helpful assistant. {{question}}
- **Response:** Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll, a green pigment in the chloroplasts.

During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the air is taken in through small openings in plant leaves called stomata. Water is also absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves. In the presence of sunlight, chlorophyll uses the energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for plants. It can be used immediately for cellular respiration to provide energy for the plant, or it can be stored in the form of starch for later use. Overall, photosynthesis is a vital process for sustaining life on Earth as it produces the oxygen we breathe and serves as the foundation of the food chain.
